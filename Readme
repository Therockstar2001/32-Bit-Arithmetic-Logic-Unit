# SystemVerilog Parameterized ALU (RTL + Self-Checking Testbench)

## Overview
This project implements a **parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL**, along with a **self-checking verification testbench**.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **fundamental RTL design skills** and **basic verification methodology** that are commonly expected in **ASIC / FPGA Design Verification** roles.

---

## Features
- Parameterized data width (default **32-bit**)
- Pure **combinational RTL** using `always_comb`
- Fully synthesizable design (no delays or simulation-only constructs)
- Supports common arithmetic and logical operations
- Self-checking testbench with:
  - Directed tests
  - Randomized stimulus
  - Golden reference model
- Automatic PASS / FAIL reporting
- Clean, industry-style project structure

## Supported ALU Operations

| Opcode | Operation |
|------|----------|
| `0x0` | Addition (`A + B`) |
| `0x1` | Subtraction (`A - B`) |
| `0x2` | Bitwise AND |
| `0x3` | Bitwise OR |
| `0x4` | Bitwise XOR |
| `0x5` | Set Less Than (signed) |
| `0x6` | Shift Left Logical |
| `0x7` | Shift Right Logical |

## Verification Methodology

# Testbench applies:

Directed sanity tests
Randomized test vectors
A golden reference model computes expected ALU outputs
DUT output is automatically compared against the expected results
Any mismatches are reported with detailed debug information
Final simulation result reports overall PASS or FAIL
This approach avoids manual waveform inspection and reflects a verification-oriented design mindset.

## Running the Simulation (EDA Playground-Aldec Riviera-PRO)
Compile
vlib work
vlog -sv rtl/alu.sv tb/tb_alu.sv

Run (command-line mode)
vsim -c tb_alu -do "run -all; exit"

Run (GUI mode)
vsim tb_alu


## Expected output:

ALL TESTS PASSED

# Tools Used
SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800)
Aldec Riviera-PRO (compile and simulation)
Riviera-PRO waveform viewer (optional)

## Possible Extensions

Add carry, overflow, and sign flags
Implement a pipelined ALU
Add SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)
Add functional coverage
Extend verification using UVM
